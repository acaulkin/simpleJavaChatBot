# About
Extremely simple Java chat "bot" built in base Java to help teach myself....Java.
Checkout the source code under src...it's only about 100 lines but I really focused on doing some of the operations in a unique way.
(For example, using a recursive call to determine if the user got the question right to a quiz or not.)

# Going Forward
Going to implement "ongoing functionality" so the user is presented with options at the start and is able to call on them to do stuff.
Ergo, instead of having the program terminate after going through Action 1 ---> Action 2 ---> ... Action N ---> Terminate, it will give
the user a list of actions they can call themselves to keep the FUN going!!!
